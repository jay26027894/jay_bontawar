        ðŸš€ Aspiring Software Developer | Web Dev Enthusiast | Problem-Solver in
        Progress Hey there! I'm Jay Bontawar, passionate about turning coffee
        â˜• and code ðŸ’» into user-friendly websites. With hands-on experience in
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, and C++, I'm diving deep into full stack
        development. I've built several interactive, real-world web projects and
        love bringing ideas to life through clean code and creative UI. Beyond
        the screen, Iâ€™ve honed leadership and teamwork skills as Vice President
        of  Nexus Forum and Co-Organizer of Techotsav. Whether it's debugging at
        2 AM or brainstorming with a team, Iâ€™m all in. Detail-driven, adaptable,
        and always eager to learn something new.
